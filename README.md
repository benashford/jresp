# jresp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/jresp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/jresp)

An asynchronous implementation of the [Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)](http://redis.io/topics/protocol) in Java.

This is *not* a Redis client, but rather a library specifically for the protocol to allow Redis clients to be built using it for various JVM languages.

## Requirements

Java 8 or higher.

## What is it?

`jresp` provides implementations for each type specified as part of the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP), specifically: [simple strings](src/main/java/jresp/protocol/SimpleStr.java), [errors](src/main/java/jresp/protocol/Err.java), [integers](src/main/java/jresp/protocol/Int.java), [bulk strings](src/main/java/jresp/protocol/BulkStr.java), and [arrays](src/main/java/jresp/protocol/Ary.java).  All these implement the `RespType` interface.

It also provides a way of communicating with a Redis server called [`Connection`](src/main/java/jresp/Connection.java).  These are created using the [`Client`](src/main/java/jresp/Client.java).

Implemented using [Netty](http://netty.io), communication is asynchronous.  When creating a `Connection` an object/closure implementing [`Responses`](src/main/java/jresp/Responses.java) needs to be provided.  Messages are written using the `write` method on `Connection`; each response from the server will result in `responseReceived` on the implementation of `Responses`.

Example:

```java
Client c = new Client("localhost", 6379);
Connection con = c.makeConnection(resp -> System.out.println("Got:" + resp));

con.write(Arrays.asList(new Ary(Arrays.asList(new BulkStr("PING")))));
```

This should print: `Got: PONG`

The final line of that example looks a bit verbose.  This is because communication between client and server takes place using RESP objects; each command to Redis is a RESP array containing one or more bulk strings for the command name and arguments.

Redis commands can be pipelined: multiple commands can be sent in one request, the responses will then be sent back from the server.  This is why `write` on `Connection` accepts a `Collection` of `RespType`.  Each response will be a one call to the `Responses` callback.  Each response will be an implementation of `RespType`, the exact type will depend on the Redis command called, see the [Redis command documentation](http://redis.io/commands) for details.

Every `RespType` can be converted to the corresponding Java type by calling `unwrap`.  E.g a `BulkStr` becomes a `String`.  This is a recursive process for RESP arrays, the array becomes a `List` and each element of the array has `unwrap` called in turn.

## What isn't it?

`jresp` is not a Redis client.  It has no knowledge of the specific Redis commands or responses.  Nor how to handle the special-case commands like `MONITOR`, it is low-level enough that it doesn't have to worry about all these things, it is just a conduit for passing serialised RESP data from client to server and back.

Nor does it make any attempt at connection pooling/reuse.  `Client` can create as many connections as it is asked to make, it is the responsibility of the caller to manage and reuse these connections.

## What is it for?

There are pre-existing Redis clients for Java, both synchronous and asynchronous.  `jresp` was specifically intended to be the backend of multiple Redis clients for various JVM languages.

As of the time of writing, it is used for [`redis-async`, a async Redis client for Clojure](https://github.com/benashford/redis-async).  I have written about the development of `jresp` and `redis-async` [here](http://benashford.github.io/blog/2015/06/02/java-in-a-polygot-jvm-world/)
