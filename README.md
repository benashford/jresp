# jresp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/jresp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benashford/jresp)

An asynchronous implementation of the [Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)](http://redis.io/topics/protocol) in Java.

This is *not a Redis client*, but rather a library specifically for the protocol to allow Redis clients to be built using it for various JVM languages.
