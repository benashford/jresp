# jresp

An asynchronous implementation of the [Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)](http://redis.io/topics/protocol) in Java.

This is *not a Redis client*, but rather a library specifically for the protocol to allow Redis clients to be built using it for various JVM languages.

## Work in progress

Not yet stable.
